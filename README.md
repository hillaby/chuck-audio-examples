Pure Data's audio examples ported to ChucK

Here you will find (sooner or later) all the audio examples that exist in Pure Data's `doc/3.audio.examples`
directory ported to Chuck. Read more about Chuck here: http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/. More info on PureData here: https://puredata.info/.

The examples correspond to chapter of a very well-written book about electronic music, which is also
free to read, so go on and try the examples listed in this directory while reading the book:
http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm.

Each one of the examples can be run easily:

`chuck <path-to-example>`

e.g.:

`chuck A01.sinewave.ck`
